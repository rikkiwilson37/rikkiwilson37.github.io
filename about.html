                            Hi, my name is Rikki Wilson. I am 16 years old, in my 11th year and I am currently enrolled at CodeRVA Regional Highschool. I found the school I currently go to be a good opportunity to find myself and to try something new. During the application process at time I was somewhat interested in the design process of building a website and how to make it pleasing to the eye. After going to the school for some time, I am starting to find new things that interest me, and might take a different path than I originally planned.
